## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Audit chain (`audit/`).** Per-record content hashes are now linked into a
  forward-chained SHA-256 chain (`chained_hash = SHA256(prev_hash || content_hash)`)
  with a genesis block (`0` * 64). Tampering with any historical record
  invalidates every subsequent link.
  - `audit_chain` table: `record_id`, `sequence_num`, `content_hash`,
    `prev_hash`, `data_hash`, `chained_at`.
  - `audit_roots` table: daily UTC Merkle roots over `audit_chain.data_hash`,
    themselves chained via `prev_root_hash`. `tsa_token` BLOB reserved for
    RFC 3161 (Phase 1.5).
  - New MCP tools: `verify_audit_chain(from_seq, to_seq)`,
    `get_daily_root(date, rebuild=False)`.
  - Existing `verify_audit_hash(trade_id)` now also surfaces the chain entry.
  - `Database.insert_trade` automatically appends to the chain on a fresh
    insert; duplicate-id inserts skip the chain append.
  - `scripts/backfill_audit_chain.py` deterministically rebuilds the chain
    and daily roots from `trade_records` (ORDER BY timestamp, id).
  - 25 new tests in `tests/test_audit_chain.py`.
- **Anti-resonance (`owm/anti_resonance.py`) — real algorithm.** Computes a
  `recall_consonance_score` in `[0, 1]` evaluating whether recalled refs
  collectively support (1.0) or oppose (0.0) the proposed direction.
  - `anti_resonance_applied = score < APPLIED_THRESHOLD` (default 0.4) — i.e.
    counter-evidence dominates. `suppression_recommended = score < 0.2`.
  - `MemoryContext` gains `recall_consonance_score`,
    `evidence_supporting_count`, `evidence_opposing_count`, and
    `suppression_recommended`.
  - 25 new tests in `tests/test_anti_resonance.py`.
- **`LIMITATIONS.md`** at repo root, linked from README. Documents validated
  vs. research-stage components, architecture gaps (no auth, no multi-tenancy,
  parallel DB stacks), broker / LLM coverage, and a per-area roadmap.

### Changed
- **`MemoryContext.anti_resonance_applied`** is no longer `len(refs) > 0`. It
  is now derived from `compute_recall_consonance` against the proposed
  direction. The three call sites (`mcp_server.py` x2 and `server.py`) all
  funnel through a `_build_memory_context` helper.
- TDR `MemoryContext` description updated to reflect the real semantic.

### Fixed
- The three call sites in `mcp_server.py` and `server.py` that set
  `anti_resonance_applied = len(refs) > 0` — a behavioural lie that was
  flagged in the pre-OTSO audit. The flag now reflects actual counter-evidence.

### Notes
- 1,428 tests pass on this release (+50 new, no regressions). 0 failures.
- Phase 5 INVALID result is retained in the research log and now explicitly
  documented in `LIMITATIONS.md` Section 1.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Evolution Engine** — automated observe → hypothesize → backtest → select loop
  - `src/tradememory/evolution/`: models, backtester, generator, selector, engine
  - LLM-powered pattern discovery (Anthropic Sonnet) with structured JSON output
  - Vectorized backtester: ATR-based SL/TP, long/short, time-based exit, dynamic Sharpe annualization
  - Hypothesis generator: explore/exploit temperature control, graveyard-aware
  - Selection & Elimination: IS rank → OOS validation (Sharpe > 1.0, trade_count > 30, max_dd < 20%)
  - Evolution Orchestrator: multi-generation, configurable population_size/mutation_rate
  - Strategy Graveyard for learning from failures
- **OWM Completion** — all 5 memory types fully implemented
  - Episodic decay: power-law S(t) = S₀ × (1 + t/τ)^(-d) × boost(n) with rehearsal boost
  - Semantic decay: Bayesian Beta(α,β) posterior update, regime_match_factor, τ=180d
  - Auto-induction: episodic patterns → semantic memory (check_auto_induction)
  - Procedural drift: CUSUM detection for behavioral stats (holding time, SL/TP ratio, disposition)
  - Affective EWMA: ewma_confidence (λ=0.9), risk_appetite linked to drawdown
  - Prospective feedback: evaluate_trigger condition matching, record_outcome tracking
- **Platform-Agnostic Data Layer** (Phase 9)
  - DataSource Protocol (runtime_checkable): fetch_ohlcv(), available_symbols()
  - Binance historical data adapter: REST API, rate limiting, parquet cache
  - Context Builder: ATR, trend, volatility regime, time-of-day from OHLCVSeries
  - MT5 CSV adapter: tab/comma auto-detect, DataSource Protocol wrapper
  - OHLCV model, Timeframe enum, OHLCVSeries with IS/OOS split()
- **Evolution MCP Tools** (Phase 11)
  - 5 new MCP tools: fetch_market_data, discover_patterns, run_backtest, evolve_strategy, get_evolution_log
  - 4 REST endpoints: POST /evolution/run, GET /evolution/runs, GET /evolution/runs/{id}, GET /evolution/graveyard
  - 3 Pydantic response models
- **Integration & Validation** (Phase 12)
  - Evolution demo script: mock BTC 1H data, 3-generation evolution, text equity curve
  - Dashboard evolution page: surviving/graveyard tables, fitness trend, run summary
  - Research log auto-write (EXP-00X format)
- 656 new tests (1,055 total, up from 399)

### Changed
- All `from src.tradememory` imports fixed to `from tradememory` (180+ files)
- Sharpe annualization now dynamic per timeframe (was hardcoded sqrt(252))
- Trailing stop uses ATR; SL/TP takes priority over time-based exit

### Stats
- 15 MCP tools (was 10), 30+ REST endpoints
- 1,055 tests passing, 0 failures
- Phases 8-12 complete (P1: 42/42, P2: 20/20)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Outcome-Weighted Memory (OWM)** — cognitive science-based recall system for AI trading agents
  - 5 memory types: Episodic trade events, Semantic strategy rules, Procedural behavioral patterns, Affective confidence/risk state, Prospective conditional plans
  - Core recall formula: `Score(m,C) = Q(m) * Sim(m,C) * Rec(m) * Conf(m) * Aff(m)`
  - Based on ACT-R (Anderson 2007), Kelly Criterion (Kelly 1956), Bayesian updating, and Tulving's memory taxonomy
- 6 new MCP tools (10 total):
  - `remember_trade` — store trade with full OWM episodic encoding
  - `recall_memories` — outcome-weighted recall with score breakdown
  - `get_behavioral_analysis` — procedural memory behavioral bias detection
  - `get_agent_state` — affective state (confidence, risk appetite, drawdown)
  - `create_trading_plan` — prospective memory conditional plans
  - `check_active_plans` — trigger condition matching against current context
- Kelly-from-memory position sizing with fractional Kelly and risk appetite adjustment
- `docs/OWM_FRAMEWORK.md` — 1,875-line theoretical specification
- OWM data migration utility (`owm/migration.py`)
- 5 new OWM database tables (episodic, semantic, procedural, affective, prospective)
- 7 new REST API endpoints under `/owm/` prefix
- 196 new tests (399 total)

### Changed
- `recall_similar_trades` MCP tool now auto-upgrades to OWM formula when episodic data exists (falls back to original logic otherwise)
- REST API server expanded with 7 new OWM endpoints under `/owm/` prefix

### Migration
- Zero breaking changes. All 4 original MCP tools work identically.
- New OWM tools are additive — use them when ready.
- Run `migration.py` to convert existing trade data to episodic format (optional).
